## Approach
This site was built with HTML, CSS, SCSS and Javascript.
I didn't use any CSS framework since I wanted to test my skills in rough CSS/SCSS and overall, I there is still more room for improvement in my code organization.
The javascript parts were the scroll to content arrows and the navbar toggle which were done with vanilla javascript.
